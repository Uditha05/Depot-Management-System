#Depot-Management-System

#Semester 3 project - Computer science and engineering - University of Moratuwa

About Project:

The depot management system is a system that can handle buses in a depot. Also, this system can use any passenger to find the bus timetable and the status of the bus at the current time. This system contains two main parts, which are passenger view and depot admin view. Passenger view is a public view that everyone can see, but administration view is handled by some main roles in the depot.

How to start:

if you are running in this in localhost first create a database and import tables in 'Database.txt' and 'Data.txt'.
